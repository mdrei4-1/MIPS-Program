# MIPS-Program
A small MIPS program I wrote for an assignment

This program was originally made for an assignment in my Computer Organization class. The purpose of the program is to take a group of numbers and add them together, with the program skipping between 1 and 4 (defined by the user) numbers after each number is added to the total.

The numbers are not my own, everything after the main label is my code. The original author of the code that I did not write is Frank Drews.
